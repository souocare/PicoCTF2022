## Approach

The link goes to something that looks like this:

![home page](./MainPage.png)

Before typing anything, I checked the cookies I have. How? Clicking on the lock sign near the link (or going to the Inspect page) will reveal. Using the first option, this is the cookie that shows up.

![Cookie after inserted phrase](./cookieafterwriting.png)

I typed in "snickerdoodle" and entered it.
After inserted, this is what it shows!

Now, let's check the cookie ...
![Cookie after inserted phrase](./changecookievalue.png)

The value changed! Hm... now what? Let's try to change the value to 1 and refreshed the page like this.
![Cookie after inserted phrase](./changecookievalue.png)

After changing the value to 1, this is the phrase that shows.
> I love chocolate chip cookies!

Well, that's a change! I tried to keep increasing the value and when I reached 18, BAM. Found the flag!
